<h1>TMS</h1>
<p><strong>Transcranial magnetic stimulation</strong> (<strong>TMS</strong>) is a <span ax="Non-invasive_procedure" title="wikilink">noninvasive</span> <span ax="neurostimulation" class="uri" title="wikilink">neurostimulation</span> technique in which a changing <span ax="magnetic_field" title="wikilink">magnetic field</span> is used to induce an <span ax="electric_current" title="wikilink">electric current</span> in a targeted area of the <span ax="brain" class="uri" title="wikilink">brain</span> through <span ax="electromagnetic_induction" title="wikilink">electromagnetic induction</span>. A device called a stimulator generates electric pulses that are delivered to a <span ax="magnetic_coil" title="wikilink">magnetic coil</span> placed against the <span ax="scalp" class="uri" title="wikilink">scalp</span>. The resulting magnetic field penetrates the <span ax="skull" class="uri" title="wikilink">skull</span> and induces a secondary electric current in the underlying brain tissue, modulating <span ax="neural_activity" title="wikilink">neural activity</span>.<span ax="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></span><span ax="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a safe, effective, and <span ax="FDA" class="uri" title="wikilink">FDA</span>-approved treatment for <span ax="major_depressive_disorder" title="wikilink">major depressive disorder</span> (approved in 2008), <span ax="chronic_pain" title="wikilink">chronic pain</span> (2013), and <span ax="obsessive-compulsive_disorder" title="wikilink">obsessive-compulsive disorder</span> (2018).<span ax="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></span> It has strong evidence for certain neurological and psychiatric conditions—especially <span ax="Depression_(mood)" title="wikilink">depression</span> (with a large <span ax="effect_size" title="wikilink">effect size</span>), <span ax="neuropathic_pain" title="wikilink">neuropathic pain</span>, and <span ax="stroke_recovery" title="wikilink">stroke recovery</span>—and emerging advancements like iTBS and image-guided targeting may improve its efficacy and efficiency.<span ax="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></span><span ax="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></span></p>
<p>Adverse effects of TMS appear rare and include <span ax="syncope_(medicine)" title="wikilink">fainting</span> and <span ax="epileptic_seizure" title="wikilink">seizure</span>, which occur in roughly 0.1% of patients and are usually attributable to administration error.<span ax="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></span> </p>

<p><img src="Neuro-ms.png" title="fig:A magnetic coil is positioned on the patient&#39;s head." alt="A magnetic coil is positioned on the patient&#39;s head." width="285" height="285" /> TMS does not require surgery or electrode implantation.</p>
<p>Its use can be diagnostic and/or therapeutic. Effects vary based on frequency and intensity of the magnetic pulses as well as the length of treatment, which dictates the total number of pulses given.<span ax="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></span> TMS treatments are approved by the FDA in the US and by <span ax="National_Institute_for_Health_and_Care_Excellence" title="wikilink">NICE</span> in the UK for the treatment of depression and are provided by private clinics and some <span ax="List_of_Veterans_Affairs_medical_facilities" title="wikilink">VA medical centers</span>.

<h3 id="diagnosis">Diagnosis</h3>
<p>TMS can be used clinically to measure activity and function of specific brain circuits in humans, most commonly with single or paired magnetic pulses.<span ax="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></span> The most widely accepted use is in measuring the connection between the <span ax="primary_motor_cortex" title="wikilink">primary motor cortex</span> of the <span ax="central_nervous_system" title="wikilink">central nervous system</span> and the <span ax="peripheral_nervous_system" title="wikilink">peripheral nervous system</span> to evaluate damage related to past or progressive neurologic insult.<span ax="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></span><span ax="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></span><span ax="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></span><span ax="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></span> TMS has utility as a diagnostic instrument for <span ax="myelopathy" class="uri" title="wikilink">myelopathy</span>, <span ax="amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis" title="wikilink">amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</span>, and <span ax="multiple_sclerosis" title="wikilink">multiple sclerosis</span>.<span ax="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></span></p>
<h3 id="treatment-and-efficacy">Treatment and efficacy</h3>
<p>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a safe, effective, and <span ax="FDA" class="uri" title="wikilink">FDA</span>-approved treatment for <span ax="major_depressive_disorder" title="wikilink">major depressive disorder</span> (approved in 2008), <span ax="chronic_pain" title="wikilink">chronic pain</span> (2013), and <span ax="obsessive-compulsive_disorder" title="wikilink">obsessive-compulsive disorder</span> (2018).<span ax="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></span></p>
<p>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (<span ax="rTMS" class="uri" title="wikilink">rTMS</span>) has been shown to produce significant clinical improvements in various neurological and psychiatric disorders. A group of European experts updated the therapeutic guidelines, reviewing studies up to the end of 2018. The highest level of evidence, Level A (definite efficacy), was found for high-frequency rTMS of the primary motor cortex (<span ax="primary_motor_cortex" title="wikilink">primary motor cortex</span>) for <span ax="neuropathic_pain" title="wikilink">neuropathic pain</span>, high-frequency rTMS of the left <span ax="dorsolateral_prefrontal_cortex" title="wikilink">dorsolateral prefrontal cortex</span> (DLPFC) for <span ax="Depression_(mood)" title="wikilink">depression</span>, and low-frequency rTMS of the contralesional motor cortex for hand motor recovery after <span ax="stroke" class="uri" title="wikilink">stroke</span>. Level B evidence (probable efficacy) was found in conditions such as <span ax="fibromyalgia" class="uri" title="wikilink">fibromyalgia</span>, <span ax="Parkinson&#39;s_disease" title="wikilink">Parkinson's disease</span>, <span ax="multiple_sclerosis" title="wikilink">multiple sclerosis</span>, <span ax="post-traumatic_stress_disorder" title="wikilink">post-traumatic stress disorder</span> (PTSD), depression, and post-stroke <span ax="aphasia" class="uri" title="wikilink">aphasia</span>, depending on the rTMS protocol used. No other conditions reached Level A or B evidence. These recommendations are based on differences in therapeutic outcomes between real and sham rTMS, replicated in multiple independent studies, although clinical relevance may still vary.<span ax="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></span></p>
<p>A 2025 consensus review published in the <span ax="Journal_of_the_Neurological_Sciences" title="wikilink">Journal of the Neurological Sciences</span> evaluated current clinical practices and recent advancements in TMS for depression. The review confirms that TMS is a safe and effective treatment modality, with a growing body of evidence supporting its use in treatment-resistant depression. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), particularly high-frequency stimulation of the left <span ax="dorsolateral_prefrontal_cortex" title="wikilink">dorsolateral prefrontal cortex</span>, has demonstrated robust and reproducible acute <span ax="antidepressant" class="uri" title="wikilink">antidepressant</span> effects in major depressive disorder, with growing evidence supporting its efficacy, durability, and potential superiority over medication in treatment-resistant cases. Traditional repetitive TMS (rTMS) protocols have been well-established, while newer approaches—such as intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) and individualized, image-guided targeting—have shown promise in reducing treatment time and potentially enhancing clinical outcomes.<span ax="#fn17" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></span></p>
<p>Existing evidence suggests that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, particularly targeting the <span ax="dorsolateral_prefrontal_cortex" title="wikilink">dorsolateral prefrontal cortex</span> and <span ax="supplementary_motor_area" title="wikilink">supplementary motor area</span>, effectively reduces obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms, while results for the <span ax="Prefrontal_cortex" title="wikilink">medial prefrontal cortex</span> and <span ax="anterior_cingulate_cortex" title="wikilink">anterior cingulate cortex</span> using deep transcranial magnetic stimulation are more variable; the overall heterogeneity of studies highlights the need for further research.<span ax="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></span></p>
<p>The effectiveness of TMS and <span ax="quality_of_evidence" title="wikilink">quality of evidence</span> behind it for treatment of depression have been questioned.<span ax="#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></span><span ax="#fn20" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></span><span ax="#fn21" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></span> As with <span ax="antidepressant" title="wikilink">antidepressants</span> and other interventions for depression, there is a large <span ax="placebo_response" title="wikilink">placebo response</span> with sham <span ax="control_group" title="wikilink">control groups</span> in TMS trials (<span ax="Hedges&#39;s_g" title="wikilink">Hedges's g</span> = 0.8).<span ax="#fn22" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></span> In any case, in a 2023 <span ax="meta-analysis" class="uri" title="wikilink">meta-analysis</span>, TMS found a large effect size advantage over sham for depression (Hedges' g = 0.791).<span ax="#fn23" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></span> On the other hand, in the two pivotal regulatory clinical trials that led to approval of TMS for treatment-resistant depression by the United <span ax="Food_and_Drug_Administration" title="wikilink">Food and Drug Administration</span> (FDA), the intervention outperformed sham by only about 2.1 to 2.8points on the MADRS at 6weeks post-treatment.<span ax="#fn24" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></span><span ax="#fn25" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></span><span ax="#fn26" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></span></p>
<h2 id="adverse-effects">Adverse effects</h2>
<p>TMS is generally advertised as a safe alternative to medications such as <span ax="SSRI" class="uri" title="wikilink">SSRI</span>'s. The greatest immediate risk from TMS is <span ax="syncope_(medicine)" title="wikilink">fainting</span>, though this is uncommon. <span ax="Epileptic_seizure" title="wikilink">Seizures</span> have been reported, but are rare.<span ax="#fn27" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></span><span ax="#fn28" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></span><span ax="#fn29" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></span></p>
<p>Risks are higher for therapeutic repetitive TMS (rTMS) than for single or paired diagnostic TMS.<span ax="#fn30" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></span> Adverse effects generally increase with higher frequency stimulation.<span ax="#fn31" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></span></p>
<h2 id="procedure">Procedure</h2>
<p>During the procedure, a magnetic coil is positioned at the head of the person receiving the treatment using anatomical <span ax="10–20_system_(EEG)" title="wikilink">landmarks</span> on the skull, in particular the <span ax="External_occipital_protuberance" title="wikilink">inion</span> and <span ax="nasion" class="uri" title="wikilink">nasion</span>.<span ax="#fn32" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></span> The coil is then connected to a pulse generator, or stimulator, that delivers electric current to the coil.<span ax="#fn33" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></span></p>
<h2 id="physics">Physics</h2>

<p><img src="TMS focal field.png" title="fig:TMS focal field.png" alt="TMS focal field.png" width="150" /> <img src="TMS Butterfly Coil HEAD.png" title="fig:TMS – butterfly coils" alt="TMS – butterfly coils" width="240" /> TMS uses <span ax="electromagnetic_induction" title="wikilink">electromagnetic induction</span> to generate an electric current across the <span ax="scalp" class="uri" title="wikilink">scalp</span> and <span ax="Human_skull" title="wikilink">skull</span>.<span ax="#fn34" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></span><span ax="#fn35" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></span> A plastic-enclosed coil of wire is held next to the skull and when activated, produces a varying <span ax="magnetic_field" title="wikilink">magnetic field</span> oriented <span ax="Orthogonality" title="wikilink">orthogonally</span> to the plane of the coil. The changing magnetic field then induces an electric current in the brain that activates nearby nerve cells in a manner similar to a current applied superficially at the cortical surface.<span ax="#fn36" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></span></p>
<p>The magnetic field is about the same strength as <span ax="magnetic_resonance_imaging" title="wikilink">magnetic resonance imaging</span> (MRI), and the pulse generally reaches no more than 5 centimeters into the brain unless using a modified coil and technique for deeper stimulation.<span ax="#fn37" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></span></p>
<p>Transcranial magnetic stimulation is achieved by quickly discharging current from a large <span ax="capacitor" class="uri" title="wikilink">capacitor</span> into a coil to produce pulsed <span ax="magnetic_fields" title="wikilink">magnetic fields</span> between 2 and 3 <span ax="Tesla_(unit)" title="wikilink">teslas</span> in strength.<span ax="#fn38" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></span> Directing the magnetic field pulse at a targeted area in the brain causes a localized electrical current which can then either <span ax="depolarization" title="wikilink">depolarize</span> or <span ax="hyperpolarization_(biology)" title="wikilink">hyperpolarize</span> neurons at that site. The induced electric field inside the brain tissue causes a change in transmembrane potentials resulting in depolarization or hyperpolarization of neurons, causing them to be more or less excitable, respectively.<span ax="#fn39" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></span></p>
<p>TMS usually stimulates to a depth from 2 to 4 cm below the surface, depending on the coil and intensity used. Consequently, only superficial brain areas can be affected.<span ax="#fn40" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></span> Deep TMS can reach up to 6 cm into the brain to stimulate deeper layers of the <span ax="motor_cortex" title="wikilink">motor cortex</span>, such as that which controls leg motion. The path of this current can be difficult to model because the brain is irregularly shaped with variable internal density and water content, leading to a nonuniform magnetic field strength and <span ax="Electrical_conduction" title="wikilink">conduction</span> throughout its tissues.<h3 id="frequency-and-duration">Frequency and duration</h3>
<p>The effects of TMS can be divided based on frequency, duration and intensity (amplitude) of stimulation:<span ax="#fn41" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Single or paired pulse TMS causes neurons in the neocortex under the site of stimulation to <span ax="Depolarization" title="wikilink">depolarize</span> and discharge an <span ax="action_potential" title="wikilink">action potential</span>. If used in the <span ax="primary_motor_cortex" title="wikilink">primary motor cortex</span>, it produces muscle activity referred to as a <span ax="Evoked_potential#Motor_evoked_potentials" title="wikilink">motor evoked potential</span> (MEP) which can be recorded on <span ax="electromyography" class="uri" title="wikilink">electromyography</span>. If used on the <span ax="occipital_cortex" title="wikilink">occipital cortex</span>, '<span ax="phosphene" title="wikilink">phosphenes</span>' (flashes of light) might be perceived by the subject. In most other areas of the cortex, there is no conscious effect, but behaviour may be altered (e.g., slower reaction time on a cognitive task), or changes in brain activity may be detected using diagnostic equipment.<span ax="#fn42" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></span></li>
<li>Repetitive TMS (rTMS) produces longer-lasting effects which persist past the period of stimulation. rTMS can increase or decrease the excitability of the <span ax="corticospinal_tract" title="wikilink">corticospinal tract</span> depending on the intensity of stimulation, coil orientation, and frequency. Low frequency rTMS with a stimulus frequency less than 1 Hz is believed to inhibit cortical firing, while a stimulus frequency greater than 1 Hz, referred to as high frequency, is believed to provoke it.<span ax="#fn43" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></span> Though its mechanism is not clear, it has been suggested as being due to a change in synaptic efficacy related to <span ax="long-term_potentiation" title="wikilink">long-term potentiation</span> (LTP) and long-term depression like plasticity (LTD-like plasticity).<span ax="#fn44" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></span><span ax="#fn45" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></span></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="coil-types">Coil types</h3>
<p>Most devices use a coil shaped like a figure-eight to deliver a shallow magnetic field that affects more superficial neurons in the brain.<span ax="#fn46" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></span> Differences in magnetic coil design are considered when comparing results, with important elements including the type of material, <span ax="geometry" class="uri" title="wikilink">geometry</span> and specific characteristics of the associated magnetic pulse.</p>
<p>The core material may be either a magnetically inert substrate ('air core'), or a solid, <span ax="ferromagnetic" title="wikilink">ferromagnetically</span> active material ('solid core'). Solid cores result in more efficient transfer of electrical energy to a magnetic field and reduce energy loss to heat, and so can be operated with the higher volume of therapy protocols without interruption due to <span ax="Overheating_(electricity)" title="wikilink">overheating</span>. Varying the geometric shape of the coil itself can cause variations in <span ax="Focus_(geometry)" title="wikilink">focality</span>, shape, and depth of penetration. Differences in coil material and its power supply also affect magnetic pulse width and duration.<span ax="#fn47" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></span></p>
<p>A number of different types of coils exist, each of which produce different magnetic fields. The round coil is the original used in TMS. Later, the figure-eight (butterfly) coil was developed to provide a more focal pattern of activation in the brain, and the four-leaf coil for focal stimulation of peripheral nerves. The double-cone coil conforms more to the shape of the head.<span ax="#fn48" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></span> The Hesed (H-core), circular crown and double cone coils allow more widespread activation and a deeper magnetic penetration. They are supposed to impact deeper areas in the motor cortex and <span ax="cerebellum" class="uri" title="wikilink">cerebellum</span> controlling the legs and <span ax="pelvic_floor" title="wikilink">pelvic floor</span>, for example, though the increased depth comes at the cost of a less focused magnetic pulse.<span ax="#fn49" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></span></p>
<h2 id="research-directions">Research directions</h2>
<p>TMS is oftentimes combined with <span ax="electroencephalography" class="uri" title="wikilink">electroencephalography</span> (EEG) to assess functional connectivity.<span ax="#fn50" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></span></p>
<p>For <span ax="Parkinson&#39;s_disease" title="wikilink">Parkinson's disease</span>, early results suggest that low frequency stimulation may have an effect on medication associated <span ax="dyskinesia" class="uri" title="wikilink">dyskinesia</span>, and that high frequency stimulation improves motor function.<span ax="#fn51" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></span><span ax="#fn52" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></span></p>
<p>The <span ax="Cerebellum" title="wikilink">cerebellar cortex</span> as a possible target of TMS has been investigated in combination with electromyography (<span ax="Electromyography" title="wikilink">EMG</span>), and a reduction in the average amplitude of <span ax="Motor_evoked_potentials" title="wikilink">motor-evoked-potentials</span> in small hand muscles has been observed when comparing paired-pulse TMS with a 6-8 ms interstimulus interval between cerebellar TMS and TMS to the primary motor cortex with single-pulse TMS to the primary motor cortex - a phenomenon termed cerebellum brain inhibition (CBI).<span ax="#fn53" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></span><span ax="#fn54" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></span> Recent investigations have built upon this phenomenon to investigate the feasibility of combining EEG with cerebellar TMS to find signatures of the cerebellum-to-cerebrum functional connectivity in high temporal resultion.<span ax="#fn55" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></span> By applying control conditions accounting for multisensory input and concomitant occipital cortex stimulation, and confirming effective cerebellar TMS by assessing CBI beforehand and modelling the induced electric field, EEG signatures of cerebellar TMS were proposed - as they may be utilized as therapeutic <span ax="Biomarker" title="wikilink">biomarkers</span> to test pharmacotherapy efficacy in <span ax="spinocerebellar_ataxia" title="wikilink">spinocerebellar ataxia</span> in the future.<span ax="#fn56" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></span><span ax="#fn57" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></span><span ax="#fn58" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></span><span ax="#fn59" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></span> However, these EEG signatures are still openly debated in the field of Brain Stimulation due to their inconsistency - likely, differing stimulation targets due to the lack of <span ax="neuronavigation" class="uri" title="wikilink">neuronavigation</span> in these studies explain these discrepancies in results.<span ax="#fn60" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></span><span ax="#fn61" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></span></p>

<p><span ax="Luigi_Galvani" title="wikilink">Luigi Galvani</span> (1737–1798) undertook research on the effects of electricity on the body in the late-eighteenth century and laid the foundations for the field of <span ax="electrophysiology" class="uri" title="wikilink">electrophysiology</span>.<span ax="#fn62" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></span> In the 1830s, <span ax="Michael_Faraday" title="wikilink">Michael Faraday</span> (1791–1867) discovered that an <span ax="electrical_current" title="wikilink">electrical current</span> had a corresponding <span ax="magnetic_field" title="wikilink">magnetic field</span>, and that changing one could induce its counterpart.<span ax="#fn63" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></span></p>

<p>The United Kingdom's <span ax="National_Institute_for_Health_and_Care_Excellence" title="wikilink">National Institute for Health and Care Excellence</span> (NICE) issues guidance to the <span ax="National_Health_Service" title="wikilink">National Health Service</span> (NHS) in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland (UK). NICE guidance does not cover whether or not the NHS should fund a procedure. Local NHS bodies (<span ax="primary_care_trust" title="wikilink">primary care trusts</span> and <span ax="hospital_trust" title="wikilink">hospital trusts</span>) make decisions about funding after considering the clinical effectiveness of the procedure and whether the procedure represents value for money for the NHS.<span ax="#fn92" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></span></p>
<p>NICE evaluated TMS for severe depression in 2007, finding that TMS was safe, but with insufficient evidence for its efficacy.<span ax="#fn93" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></span> Guidance was updated and replaced in 2015, concluding that evidence for short‑term efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for depression was adequate, although the clinical response is variable, and ruling that rTMS for depression may be used with arrangements for clinical governance and audit.<span ax="#fn94" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></span></p>
<p>In January 2014, NICE reported the results of an evaluation of TMS for treating and preventing migraine (IPG 477). NICE found that short-term TMS is safe but there is insufficient evidence to evaluate safety for long-term and frequent uses. It found that evidence on the efficacy of TMS for the treatment of migraine is limited in quantity, that evidence for the prevention of migraine is limited in both quality and quantity.<span ax="#fn95" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></span></p>

<p>, use of rTMS in the UK was reported to have remained limited due to the cost of equipment and establishing treatment centres. Camilla Nord, head of the Mental Health Neuroscience Lab at the <span ax="University_of_Cambridge" title="wikilink">University of Cambridge</span> said, &quot;The NHS has unfortunately been far behind the US and Canada on rTMS, which is at least as effective as antidepressants, if not more&quot;.<span ax="#fn96" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></span></p>

<p>Policies for Medicare coverage vary among local jurisdictions within the Medicare system,<span ax="#fn105" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></span> and Medicare coverage for TMS has varied among jurisdictions and with time. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>In early 2012 in <span ax="New_England" title="wikilink">New England</span>, Medicare covered TMS for the first time in the United States.<span ax="#fn106" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></span><span ax="#fn107" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></span><span ax="#fn108" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></span><span ax="#fn109" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></span> However, that jurisdiction later decided to end coverage after October, 2013.<span ax="#fn110" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></span></li>
<li>In August 2012, the jurisdiction covering Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Colorado, Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico determined that there was insufficient evidence to cover the treatment,<span ax="#fn111" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></span> but the same jurisdiction subsequently determined that Medicare would cover TMS for the treatment of depression after December 2013.<span ax="#fn112" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></span></li>
