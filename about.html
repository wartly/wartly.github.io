<h3>Why I wartly</h3>
<p>I've been wartlying since the age of 6, ever since I first developed it. Since then, I have grown a strong passion for wartly. I highly recommend wartlying as it is a great way to spend a sesh, as it entertains you and stuff.</p>
<h3>How wartly began</h3>
<p>Wartly originated as a way to talk to TMS. Since then, it has expanded to a social media website, as well as a livestreaming service (wartlive), video sharing service (warteos & shortlys), and educational resource sharing utility (wartschool). Wartly has grown rapidly since its initial release, with now over 4 billion monthly users.</p>
<h3>About GD...</h3>
<p>I have played GD for most of my life. I have now become a skilled player, with over 100 stars and a few moons. I am yet to beat my first demon, but I am still trying. My current hardest is a 7 star level. Pretty still right.</p>
<h3>About Fortnite...</h3>
<p>I love to have a good sesh on fortnite from time to time. Nothing like a good 4 hours undisturbed of grinding on blitz or zero build reload. I'm in a squa with Ship, Shogun X, and either Helsie or sometimes GD <a href="/colon">Colon</a>. I consider myself quite skilled at the game.</p>
<h3>Future plans</h3>
<p>I will continue to develop the wartly enterprise and make dosh. I will also continue my daily fortnite and gd streams on twitch and wartlive. Coming soon: Minesweeper NPCs.</p>
<h3>Are wartly and kwalla the same person??</h3>
<p>No, wartly and kwalla are not the same person. I am wartly. Kwalla is kwalla. However we do collab a lot, so we share accounts for things like GD etc.</p>
