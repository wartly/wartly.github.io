    <h1>How does it work??</h1>
    <p style="width: 70%; padding-left: 15%">You might be wondering, 'just how do you plan on sending me to the moon, for free? 🤔'. Well, this is how!<br>
    At the top of each page, there is a small button that allows you to upload a photo of yourself.<br>
    As you scroll, the file rises up.<br>
    Scroll some more, and eventually the file will go off screen...<br>
    This software works off a theory called Scroll Theory.<br>
    Scroll Theory is a theory developed by computer scientist, Wartly<br>
    Scroll Theory states that any element that leaves the top of your screen, is actually still moving up in a hypothetical space.<br>
    Every website is ran on a server, which is in a specific location.<br>
    Although the element is not rendered above your screen, Scroll Theory suggests that it's data and location is still being calculated, in the location of the server. <br>
    Even in the location of the server, the viewport is not rendered, but it's data is stored.<br>
    This means, that the viewport could be infinitly big.<br>
    This is hard to understand, even for us scientists, and that is why this remains just a theory.<br>
    Using this theory, we can conclude that by the time you reach the bottom of the 'climbing screen', the file will be a certain height in the sky.<br>
    We have calculated the heights of each climbing screen, and they match the heights of each location.<br>
    That is it 👍</p>
